### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Sam.

Iâ€™m a rookie self-taught Python developer decided to switch careers in his 30-es after working in military equipment :helicopter: sales for over 5 years.
Open-minded, lifetime learner, eager for the opportunity to learn and experience something new in the limitless field of software.

Iâ€™m currently in the process of transitioning to professional software development, so if you have a project related to Python or Django or maybe even a job offer feel free to contact me.
